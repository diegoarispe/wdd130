    <p aling="center">Hi! my name is Diego, and I'm excited to be here and study with you all this semester. I am from Bolivia (South America) and     currently pursuing a degree in Applied Management, one thing that I love the most studing at BYUI is the leaning model and how the education that we recieve invites you to discover ways to applied this in your daily life, this is very helpful to me because when I study something that  I know I will use actively in my work and career I have more energy to do it and learn much faster. 
    My hobbies are waching series in my free time, I found this a stress relief experience after a day of work, also I love playing chess.</p>
    <p>Something that I realized a while ago was that every business depends highly in technology thats why I want to learn more about it, since most of the time we are conected to the internet so it makes sense that web pages are a big deal for companys so learning about them will be a skill that I would like to obtain, this is the reason for me to enter in this class, to  learn more about technology and it's relation to a company, espciaclly programing and web pages.</p>
    <p>I hope we can all work together this semester and get to know each other.</p>
